                SkinSight AI is a machine learning-based tool developed to assist in the early detection and classification of skin cancer. It leverages computer vision and clinical data to differentiate between benign and malignant skin lesions. Our goal was to create a fast, accessible, and non-invasive solution that can support healthcare professionals and help raise awareness among the general public.

                The project uses publicly available images from the NIH Skin Cancer Dataset, along with basic clinical metadata, to train a deep learning model capable of accurate classification. As a secondary aim, the system is designed to explore the potential for further subcategorization into specific types of skin cancer.
